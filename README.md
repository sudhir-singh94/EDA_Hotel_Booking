# EDA_Hotel_Booking
Hotel Booking Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Summary
In this project, we explore a dataset containing booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. This dataset provides valuable insights into the patterns and factors that govern hotel bookings. The analysis aims to determine the optimal time of year to book a hotel room, the ideal length of stay for the best daily rate, and the factors affecting the number of special requests.

# Dataset
The dataset includes information such as when the booking was made, the length of stay, the number of adults, children, and babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data, ensuring the privacy of the guests while still allowing for rich analysis.

# Key Findings
The city hotel has more bookings compared to the resort hotel, with the busiest months for bookings being August, July, and May.
More bookings are not canceled than canceled, but bookings made further in advance were found to be more likely to be canceled.
The city hotel tends to receive more special requests than the resort hotel.
The city hotel makes significantly more total revenue than the resort hotel, likely due to its higher number of bookings.

# Objectives
Our EDA focuses on the following business objectives:

Maximize Occupancy Rates: Understand patterns in booking behavior to ensure maximum occupancy throughout the year.

Optimize Pricing Strategy: Tailor pricing strategies based on when and how customers book rooms.

Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Predict the likelihood of special requests to better prepare for guest needs.

Efficient Resource Allocation: Understand the factors that influence cancellations to better manage room inventory.

Tailored Marketing Efforts: Guide more effective marketing efforts with insights into customer behavior.

Increase Revenue: All of the above objectives ultimately aim to increase hotel revenue.

Tools and Techniques
The project makes use of Python programming language along with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Numpy for numerical computations.

# Conclusion
The insights derived from this analysis can help hoteliers make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and service offerings. Additionally, understanding these patterns can help customers make better booking decisions, optimizing their stay based on their personal needs and preferences.
